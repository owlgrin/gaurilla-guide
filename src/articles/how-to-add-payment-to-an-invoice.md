It is a good habit to keep track of how much much you have earned and how much is expected. This lets you do just that.

1. Login into your Gaurilla account and set the workspace.

2. You can add an income against an invoice in two ways:

	1. **Immediate Payment**: We understand that you might have clients who pay you immediately after receiving your invoice. For these moments, click **Pay** button in the top-right corner right after publishing an invoice.

	2. Or, if you receive deffered payments, you can come back to **Slips**, and then filter out the invoice against which you received the payment and then click on **More** >> **Pay** in the bottom-right corner.

3. For a healthy record-keeping, please fill in as many things you can.

	1. Either fill in the **name of the income** or select the **client** from which you have received this money. You can fill both too but at least one of them is required.

	2. Select the **mode** of income & provide a suitable **reference number**.

		> **Pro Tip:** For example, if you received this money through cheque, you might want to record Cheque Number as reference number. Or for receiveing money through PayPal, Transaction ID becomes a good candidate for reference number.

	3. **Currency** will be ineditable as it will be same as of invoice's but **exchange rate** can be edited depending upon the present value.

	4. Mention the **date** on which the income is received and the **total amount** of the income.

	5. Select the **category** of income.

		> **Pro Tip:** Make more categories if required, as you can generate report of incomes grouped by these categories.

	6. Select the **account** in which you received this money. You can think of this account as your bank accounts or the "Cash In Hand".
	
		> **Pro Tip:** Make more accounts if required, as you can generate report of incomes grouped by these accounts.	

	7. You can write the **note**, which is any piece of information you wish to associate with this income.

		> **Pro Tip:** Write anything that you want to remember for this income.

4. Click on **Save** to add the income.

	> **Pro Tip:** Now onwards, this income is visible in the list in **Transactions** >> **Incomes** section.

	1. Fill in the **company name**, which you want to add to your account.

	2. Mention the address of the corresponding company in the **company address** field.

	3. You need at least one financial year to work in. Add initial financial year for the company in the **financial year** field.

		> **Pro Tip:** Try to keep the financial year name in terms of years like 2013 - 2014. It would be helpful for you to recognise the right financial year later in reports.

	4. Select the base currency in **currency** option. It is usually the one in which accounting is to be done. Also, if you want to use specific currency sign for this curreny, you can do it through **currency sign** option right beside it.

4. Click on **Create** button at the bottom right of the form to add the company.

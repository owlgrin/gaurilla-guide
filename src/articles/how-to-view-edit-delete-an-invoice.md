Nothing is permanent, and so are your invoices. ;) Gaurilla lets you make changes to your already created invoices easily.

1. Login into your Gaurilla account and set the workspace.

2. Click on **Slips** option from the main navigation in the left side.

4. You can zero in on a particular invoice using the filter options given on the left.

5. Once you've found the invoice you want to work with, find the options to View, Edit and Delete in the bottom-right corner of it.

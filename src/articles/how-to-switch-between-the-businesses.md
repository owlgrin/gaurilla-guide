Switching from one business to another is as simple as click, click, click. Done!

1. Click on the dashboard icon, which is the red **G** in the top left corner.

2. The top-right corner on dashboard shows you the current workspace you are working in. Click on the **Change** button right next to it to switch to different workspace.

3. Here, you can select a different business to work in. Or if you prefer creating a new business, [you can do that as well]({{site.url}}/articles/how-to-add-a-new-company).

4. Click on **Set Workspace** to switch to the new workspace.

*Note: Moving forward, we may remove the intermediate workspace selection screen, and hence switching between different business would be just one click. The guide will be updated when it'd happen!*

You can view reports of all transactions of a money account and print that report as well if needed.

1. Login into your Gaurilla account and set the workspace.

2. Click on **Reports** >> **Money Accounts** option from the left main navigation bar in the left.

3. Select the **Money Account** from the left side drop-down and click on **Generate** to view report.

4. Add the **From** & **To** date in next two blanks to filter the result between a time frame.

	> **Pro Tip:** From and To, by default, are first and recent transaction date respectively for a money account , so if both would be blank then report would include all transactions till recent transaction date. You can put limits on dates simply by mentioning values.

5. Click on **Summary Report** button at the top right corner of the window to view the summary of all money accounts balance report. **From** & **To** date can be used to filter the result between a time frame.

	> **Pro Tip:** You can toggle between detailed and summary report using the same button on same window. 

6. Click on sky blue coloured **Print** button, adjacent to **Summary Report** button, to print the generated report.

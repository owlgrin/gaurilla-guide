Invoice is a document that you give to your customer that clearly states how much she owes you, for what and on what terms. Creating an invoice in Gaurilla is very simple.

1. Login into your Gaurilla account and set the workspace in which you wish to generate an invoice.

2. As you land on the dashboard with all sort of options around you, click on the **Slips** button which you will find just below the dashboard icon (the red G).

3. At the top right corner the **New** button is what you are looking for in order to generate an invoice.

4. The new slip window will have all the options to enter all the details which you need to specify in order to generate your invoice.

5. The slip type is checked to invoice, the next invoice number and today's date will be filled automatically. Of course you can change these. Simply click on these to edit.

6. Select the client you are dealing with in context of this particular invoice or you can add a new client by clicking on the *Create New* button. ([Click here to know how to create a client/customer]({{site.url}}/articles/how-to-create-a-client)).

7. Fill in the Gate Pass Number & Purchase Order Number with corresponding date (if needed).

8. Now you need to fill in the items for which you are invoicing your client. You need to select the item(s) for which the current invoice is being generated followed by the description, price and the quantity. Or if the the item is not in the list, you can create a new item by clicking on **Create New** button. ([Click here to know how to create an item]({{site.url}}/articles/how-to-create-an-item)).

9. In the **Others** column, mention if any other addition or deduction that needs to be done on the price like that of Courier, Discounts etc. For each *other*, there are three options, which precisely lets you control what has to be done.
    
    > **Pro Tip:** When applying a **_discount_**, you would choose options Subtract, Before Taxes and either Flat or Percentage as per need. Or when adding **_shipping charges_**, you would choose Add, After Taxes and most probably Flat.

10. Mention the terms which should be there on the invoice in context of the product or the service. The default terms, which will be by default pre-filled next time, can be saved from the **Terms** option in the **Settings** icon.

11. In **Adjustments** section select a tax scheme to apply on current invoice or add new tax scheme by clicking on the **Create New** button over the drop-down menu. ([Click here to know how to create a tax scheme]({{site.url}}/articles/how-to-create-a-tax-scheme)).

12. Now, select the word notation, in which invoice would be created.
    
    > **Pro Tip:** Indian Notation includes notations like Lakhs, Crores, etc and Standard notation includes notations like Millions, Billions, etc.

13. Your invoice is almost ready for the creation and you will see the total amount of your invoice in the right panel. Round off the total as per your wish using the options available and your invoice is ready!
    
    > **Pro Tip:** _None_ will not round off the amount, _Natural_ will round of naturally to nearest one, _Up_ will round of to next nearest one and _Down_ will round off to previous nearest one.

14. Once done, click on **Publish** to see the invoice.

    > **Pro Tip:** Send this customer a hand-written note to say thank you for the business. She'd feel nice. :)

    ### High Fives! You just invoiced your first customer using Gaurilla.

15. Once you have created your first invoice, you get several options on the top-right corner to act on the invoice.
    
    > **Pro Tip:** Using the envelope icon, you can send this invoice directly your client's inbox without even leaving Gaurilla. Go ahead, try it out.

16. The invoice we have just generated will appear in the **Slips** window for future reference and making payments.

    > **Pro Tip:** Next time you can create an invoice right from the Dashboard. Simply click on **+ Invoice** from the dashboard and start invoicing.

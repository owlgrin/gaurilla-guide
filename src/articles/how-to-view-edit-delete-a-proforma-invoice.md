Nothing is permanent, and so are your proforma invoices. ;) Gaurilla lets you make changes to your already created proforma invoices easily.

1. Login into your Gaurilla account and set the workspace.

2. Click on **Slips** icon which is on the left sidebar.

3. Click on **Proforma Invoice** from the blue colored options to view all the proforma invoices based on the filtered details.

4. You can zero in on a particular proforma invoice using the filter options given on the left.

5. Once you've found the proforma invoice you want to work with, find the options to View, Edit and Delete in the bottom-right corner of it.

	> **Pro Tip:** Option to Edit and Delete lies under the **More** drop down.

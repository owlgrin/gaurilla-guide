Nothing is permanent, and so are your proforma invoices. ;) Gaurilla lets you make changes to your already created proforma invoices easily.

1. Login into your Gaurilla account and set the workspace.

2. Click on **Slips** option from the main navigation in the left side.

4. You can zero in on a particular proforma invoice using the filter options given on the left.

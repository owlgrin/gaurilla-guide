Sometimes, there's a procedure that your business need to follow. Sending over a quote, getting it accepted and then sending over the invoice. It makes no sense if you have to create similar invoice from scratch. Gaurilla lets you convert your quotes to invoice in one click.

1. Login into your Gaurilla account and set the workspace in which you wish to generate an invoice.

2. As you land on the dashboard with all sort of options around you, click on the **Slips** button which you will find just below the dashboard icon (the red G).

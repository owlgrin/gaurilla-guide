Gaurilla allows you to customize your invoices by letting you add your own logo, name, address, contact details and other documents (if required).

1. Login into your Gaurilla account and set the workspace.

2. Click on **Settings** >> **Layout** option from main navigation bar on the left side.

3. If it is first time, don't forget to upload a logo of your company. Additionally, you can edit any fields present there.

	> **Pro Tip:** To keep you old invoices in tact as they are, these changes will take effect for the invoices you'll create from now.

4. Click on **Save** to apply changes.

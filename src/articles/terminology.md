We do not want to confuse you with technical words and make you run away. Instead, we try our best to keep this jargon at the minimum level. However, it is always a good idea to have a quick refresher about the terms used in the app.

Here are the few things that you will find useful time and again.

***

#### Company
You, an user, can create and manage multiple businesses in your one single Gaurilla account. Each of these businesses is called a "company" in terms of Gaurilla.

***

#### Invoice, Quote, Proforma Invoice
* **Invoice:** An invoice is an official document that you send to your customers which describes the services/products served, the amount due and the terms.

* **Quote:** A quote is another official document that you send to your customers, which is similar to invoice but is sent before the services are served. It is used to get the amount and terms approved before you go ahead with serving your customers.

* **Proforma Invoice:** A proforma invoice is an official document which is exactly similar to the invoice but doesn't affect the accounts.

*Collectively, these three documents are called **Slips** in Gaurilla.*

***

#### Income and Expense
The money that comes in your business is the income and the money that goes out is the expense.

*Collectively, these two kind of money movements are called **Transactions**.*

***

#### Clients and Vendors
People, to whom you serve your services are called clients and the people, form whom you take services are the vendors.

*Collectively, clients and vendors are called **People**.*

***

#### Item
Your services and products are called Items in your Gaurilla account.

***

#### Others
The charges or discounts that you can add in the invoices to account for miscellaneous things are called Others.

***

#### Tax Scheme
A group of taxes that you can apply in slips at once.

***

#### Basket
Basket is your own storage space in the Gaurilla account. It is there to keep all your bank statements, receipts, miscellaneous documents at one single place.

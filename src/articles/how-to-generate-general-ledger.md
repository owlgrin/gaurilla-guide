You can generate a report of everything that happened in your business. Of course, the report can be printed or downloaded as PDF for offline access.

1. Login into your Gaurilla account and set the workspace.

2. Click on **Reports** >> **General Ledger** option from the left main navigation bar in the left.

3. Select the period for which you want to see the general ledger and then click on **Generate** to generate it.

	> **Pro Tip:** If nothing is passed in either **From** or **To** fields, the report will be generated for whole financial year for which the workspace is selected.

4. You can print the generated report using the **Print** button and download it as PDF using the **PDF** button.

	> **Pro Tip:** If nothing is passed in either **From** or **To** fields, the report will be generated for whole financial year for which the workspace is selected.

4. Click on **Summary Report** button at the top right corner of the window to view the summary of all expenses through all vendors. **From** and **To** date can be used to filter the result between a time frame.

You can generate a detailed report of all the transaction that happened between you and a particular client. Of course, the report can be printed or downloaded as PDF for offline access.

1. Login into your Gaurilla account and set the workspace.

2. Click on **Reports** >> **Clients** option from the left main navigation bar in the left.

3. Select the **Client** for which you want to generate the report using drop-down, select the period for which you want to generate the report and click on **Generate** to generate the report.

	> **Pro Tip:** If nothing is passed in **From** and **To** fields, the report will be generated for whole financial year for which the workspace is selected.

4. Click on **Summary Report** button at the top right corner of the window to view the summary of all clients balance report. **From** and **To** date can be used to filter the result between a time frame.

	> **Pro Tip:** You can easily toggle between detailed and summary report using this button.

5. You can print the generated report using the **Print** button and download it as PDF using the **PDF** button.

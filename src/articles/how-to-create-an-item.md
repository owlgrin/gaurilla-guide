Items are the things that you are selling for your business. They can either be physical products or just services that your business offers. Anything that comes for a price is an item.

1. Login into your Gaurilla account and set the required workspace.

2. Click on the **Items** icon from the main navigation on the left.

4. Fill in item's **name**, **description** and **price** of the single unit of the item.

	> **Pro Tip:** These are the default information and you can change these for individual quote/invoice when adding.

5. Now, select the type of item you are creating - whether it is a **Service** or **Product**.

	> **Pro Tip:** There is no tracking of stock for services and at least some stock is needed to be there for products.

6. Click on **Create** to save the newly created item.

				<h1>Understanding the Dashboard</h1>
			</div>
			<p class="lead">Knowing the revolutionary dashboard, called Blocks</p>
			<p>This is your dashboard which we have designed to make accountancy awesome and we call it <strong><em>Blocks</em></strong>. The dashboard which is making you spell bound right now is made up of fundamental units which we call Blocks.Although they are fixed for the public beta version but we are working to make them configurable and customisable for version 1.0. Just be prepared for the awesomeness to blow your mind away.</p>

<p><img src="http://guide.gaurilla.com/images/dashboard/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" /></p>

<p>We tried to create the dashboard by putting all the numbers and stats one might find useful in a single place. We, ourselves, use Gaurilla to manage our businesses and this dashboard helps us make some decisions quickly.</p>

<h3>Selected Workspace</h3>

<p>The top right corner of the dashbaord always shows the workspace you are currently working in. In the screen shot below, user is managing <strong>Owlgrin (India) Private Limited</strong> company and its <strong>(2013-2014)</strong> financial year.</p>

<p><img src="http://guide.gaurilla.com/images/dashboard/workspace.png" alt="dashboard-workspace" /></p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> You can click on <strong><em>Change</em></strong> to change the workspace. Managing multiple businesses has never been so much easier.</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<h3>The day which matters the most: Today</h3>

<p>The top left corner of the product shows you the date &amp; day as per your geographical location so now you don’t have to waste important seconds at work recalling the date! Quite healthy for the plan in your neural system!</p>

<p><img src="http://guide.gaurilla.com/images/dashboard/today.png" alt="dashboard-today" /></p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep dashboard open when not invoicing as it contains all the important bits of information about your business.</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<h3>People who matter you the most: Clients</h3>

<p>In block, adjacent to date, you will be shown the number of clients you are dealing with. We have found in our researches that the urge to move this number high, results in business growth. With Gaurilla, we not only want you to manage efficiently, but also want to see you grow.</p>

<p><img src="http://guide.gaurilla.com/images/dashboard/client.png" alt="dashboard-clients" /></p>

<p>Keeping track of the number of clients you are dealing with and having that number staring back at you is certainly an alarming thing to keep you on your toes! We love to see you strive hard for the pinnacle in your business.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Today a startup/SME and tomorrow a huge company - that's what we want for you. Keep this number growing.</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<h3>The measure of your consistency: Streak</h3>

<p>Generally, a streak is the duration of continuous activity. In case of Gaurilla, the streak tells the number of continuous days you invoiced your clients. Now, there are two numbers – one is the <strong>longest streak</strong> you ever had and another is the <strong>current streak</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="http://guide.gaurilla.com/images/dashboard/streak.png" alt="dashboard-streak" /></p>

<p>Longest Streak is the maximum number of days you continuously invoiced your clients while Current Streak is the current number of days you continuously are invoicing your clients.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep increasing your streak as your streak tells you how good your business is going. Work to invoice at least one client every day. There’s nothing more hurting than seeing your streak going from 43 to 0. So, do not let a day go by without creating an invoice.</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<h3>Let’s get to business: New Invoice</h3>

<p>How do you maintain the streak? Simple, invoice your clients. The first action on your dashboard starts here! Click to put a new stepping stone in your business and invoice your client.</p>

<p><img src="http://guide.gaurilla.com/images/dashboard/invoice.png" alt="dashboard-new" /></p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When hurry, directly click on <strong><em>+ Invoice</em></strong> from the dashboard itself to directly start creating invoice.</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<h3>The graph of progress: Nerd Stats</h3>

<p>The big graph shows the stats any business owner should be interested in – how much money you have earned, spent and left. Nothing fancy, just what you want, right on your dashboard.</p>

<p><img src="http://guide.gaurilla.com/images/dashboard/graphs.png" alt="dashboard-graph" /></p>

<p>Also, there are three variants of the graph, which can be switched between from the top-right corner of the graph. Month’s graph shows you how much you made in the current month, Year’s graph shows the stats for current financial year and Overall shows the stats from eternity to eternity (see how you progressed over years).</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For quick decisions, refer the Month’s view. To track progress refer Year’s view. And to track growth refer Overall’s view.</p></blockquote>
